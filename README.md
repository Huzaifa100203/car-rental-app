# Car Rental App

A web application for users to browse, book, and manage car rentals.

## Overview

This project is a web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). It aims to provide a user-friendly platform for individuals to easily find and rent cars from various providers. The application includes features for browsing available cars, viewing details, making bookings, managing existing rentals, and user authentication. The frontend is built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS, while Redux is used for state management. The backend is powered by Node.js and Express.js, with MongoDB as the database.

## Features

Based on the codebase, the app currently includes or aims to include the following features:

* **Car Listings:** Displaying a list of available cars with relevant details such as model, make, rental price, and availability.
* **Car Details:** A dedicated page to view comprehensive information about a selected car, including images, features, and rental terms.
* **Booking Process:** Functionality to select rental dates and initiate the booking process.
* **User Authentication:** Secure user registration and login functionality.
* **User Interface:** A responsive and modern user interface built with React and styled with Tailwind CSS.
* **State Management:** Utilizing Redux for predictable and centralized state management on the frontend.
* **API Endpoints:** RESTful API endpoints developed with Node.js and Express.js for data fetching and manipulation.
* **Database:** MongoDB for storing application data, including car listings, user information, and bookings.

## Technologies Used

* **Frontend:**
    * **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
    * **Redux:** A predictable state container for JavaScript applications.
    * **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
    * **Other Frontend Libraries:** (Check `package.json` in the `client` directory for a complete list).
* **Backend:**
    * **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

    * **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database used for storing application data.
    * **Mongoose:** An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
    * **Other Backend Libraries:** (Check `package.json` in the root directory for a complete list).

## Getting Started

To run this application on your local machine, you will need to have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed. You will also need a MongoDB instance running.

### Prerequisites

* **Node.js and npm (or yarn):** Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn installed. You can download them from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/) or [https://yarnpkg.com/](https://yarnpkg.com/).
* **MongoDB:** Ensure you have a MongoDB instance running locally or have access to a remote MongoDB database. You can find installation instructions on the official MongoDB website: [https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Huzaifa100203/car-rental-app.git](https://github.com/Huzaifa100203/car-rental-app.git)
    cd car-rental-app
    ```

2.  **Install backend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd client
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    cd ..
    ```

### Configuration

1.  **Backend Configuration:**
    * Create a `.env` file in the root directory based on the `.env.example` file (if provided).
    * Configure your MongoDB connection URI and any other necessary environment variables in the `.env` file.

2.  **Frontend Configuration:**
    * Create a `.env` file in the `client` directory based on the `.env.example` file (if provided).
    * Configure the API base URL if necessary.

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the backend server:**
    ```bash
    npm run server
    # or
    yarn server
    ```
    (Check your `package.json` for the exact script name, it might be `start` or something else).

2.  **Start the frontend development server:**
    ```bash
    cd client
    npm start
    # or
    yarn start
    ```

The frontend application will typically be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`, and the backend API might be running on a different port (check your backend logs or configuration).

## API Endpoints

The backend API endpoints are defined in the `server/routes/` directory. Common endpoints might include:

* `/api/cars`: For fetching car listings.
* `/api/cars/:id`: For fetching details of a specific car.
* `/api/bookings`: For creating and managing bookings.
* `/api/auth/register`: For user registration.
* `/api/auth/login`: For user login.

Refer to the code in the `server/routes/` directory for a comprehensive list of available endpoints.

## State Management (Frontend)

The frontend utilizes Redux for managing the application state. Key components include:

* **Actions:** Define events that can be dispatched to modify the state.
* **Reducers:** Specify how the state should change in response to actions.
* **Store:** Holds the application's state and provides mechanisms to dispatch actions and subscribe to state changes.

The Redux-related files are typically located in the `client/src/redux/` directory.

## Styling (Frontend)

The frontend is styled using Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. This allows for rapid styling by applying predefined utility classes directly in the HTML or JSX. Custom styles or configurations might be present in the `client/src/styles/` directory.
